# üß© Design Pattern: Command Pattern

With the **Command Pattern**, we can decouple objects that execute a certain task from the object that calls the method.

## üç± Real-World Analogy

Let‚Äôs say we have an online food delivery platform. Users can place, track, and cancel orders.

```javascript
class OrderManager {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = [];
  }

  placeOrder(order, id) {
    this.orders.push(id);
    return `You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`;
  }

  trackOrder(id) {
    return `Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`;
  }

  cancelOrder(id) {
    this.orders = this.orders.filter(order => order.id !== id);
    return `You have canceled your order ${id}`;
  }
}
```

On the `OrderManager` class, we have access to the `placeOrder`, `trackOrder` and `cancelOrder` methods. It would be totally valid JavaScript to just use these methods directly!

```javascript
const manager = new OrderManager();

manager.placeOrder("Pad Thai", "1234");
manager.trackOrder("1234");
manager.cancelOrder("1234");
```

However, there are downsides to invoking the methods directly on the manager instance. It could happen that we decide to rename certain methods later on, or the functionality of the methods change.

Say that instead of calling it `placeOrder`, we now rename it to `addOrder`! This would mean that we would have to make sure that we don‚Äôt call the `placeOrder` method anywhere in our codebase, which could be very tricky in larger applications.

Instead, we want to decouple the methods from the manager object, and create separate command functions for each command!

## üîÅ Refactoring with an `execute` method

Let‚Äôs refactor the `OrderManager` class: instead of having the `placeOrder`, `cancelOrder` and `trackOrder` methods, it will have one single method: `execute`.

```javascript
class OrderManager {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = [];
  }

  execute(command, ...args) {
    return command.execute(this.orders, ...args);
  }
}
```

## üß± Command Definitions

We need to create three Commands for the order manager:

- `PlaceOrderCommand`
- `CancelOrderCommand`
- `TrackOrderCommand`

```javascript
class Command {
  constructor(execute) {
    this.execute = execute;
  }
}

function PlaceOrderCommand(order, id) {
  return new Command((orders) => {
    orders.push(id);
    return `You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`;
  });
}

function CancelOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command((orders) => {
    orders = orders.filter((order) => order.id !== id);
    return `You have canceled your order ${id}`;
  });
}

function TrackOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command(() => `Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`);
}
```

Perfect! Instead of having the methods directly coupled to the `OrderManager` instance, they‚Äôre now separate, decoupled functions that we can invoke through the `execute` method.

## üß™ Full Example

```javascript
class OrderManager {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = [];
  }

  execute(command, ...args) {
    return command.execute(this.orders, ...args);
  }
}

class Command {
  constructor(execute) {
    this.execute = execute;
  }
}

function PlaceOrderCommand(order, id) {
  return new Command(orders => {
    orders.push(id);
    console.log(`You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`);
  });
}

function CancelOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command(orders => {
    orders = orders.filter(order => order.id !== id);
    console.log(`You have canceled your order ${id}`);
  });
}

function TrackOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command(() =>
    console.log(`Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`)
  );
}

const manager = new OrderManager();

manager.execute(new PlaceOrderCommand("Pad Thai", "1234"));
manager.execute(new TrackOrderCommand("1234"));
manager.execute(new CancelOrderCommand("1234"));
```

## ‚úÖ Pros

- Decouples methods from the object that executes the operation.
- Useful for commands that should be queued, stored, or executed at specific times.

## ‚ùå Cons

- Limited use cases.
- May introduce unnecessary boilerplate in simpler applications.
